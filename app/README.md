# Vue.js Boilerplate

I did some research in order to find the perfect folder structure, component architecture, and naming convention, I went through the Vue.js documentation, a few articles and many GitHub open source projects.

Vue.js directory structure with following packages/functionality. 

- **vuex** with modules 
- **router** with meta
- services with token based access
- environment variable
- filters.
- **pages and component** structure

This structure might be helpful in your large project/application, However Vue doesn't really restrict how you structure your code.
